# PythonAFProject

This takes files from the main.txt, and acros.txt and converts them to strings to check.
   
   It then runs through each program to check the given files.
   
   Finally, it will output suggestions from 4 categories:
   
   -acronyms not on list or on list but not in bullets
   
   -misspellings checked against dictionary and approved abbreviations
   
   -duplicate items
   
   -misc tips (double space after '!', no spacing with '--', etc.)
        
The file is a tool to use for Air Force OPR/EPR/Awards to proofread them. AF currently has no program for this.
